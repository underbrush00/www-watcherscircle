      <h2>Why We're Here</h2>
      <p>
        Watchers Circle is a public watchdog project. We provide a safe, anonymous space to report unethical or harmful behavior by those in positions of trust — whether they work in government, health care, housing, social services, education, or any community-serving role.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our focus includes, but is not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Environmental or human rights violations</li>
        <li>Abuse of power by public officials or professionals</li>
        <li>Neglect or mistreatment of vulnerable populations</li>
        <li>Corruption, coercion, fraud, or misconduct</li>
        <li>Harmful exploitation of any kind</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Submissions are verified and stored with care. Our mission is to build a circle of accountability — where no harm goes unseen.
